<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2><p> In this project, I implemented a cloth simiulator using masses and springs. For pointmasses, I summed all of the external and spring correction forces, and then found each point mass's new position based on whether the point mass was pinned or not. After building this foundation, I then added other features, including collisons with other objects such as a sphere and plane. I also implemented self-collisions. For the final part of the project, I implemented different kinds of shaders including diffusion, Phong, texture mapping, bump mapping, displacement mapping, and mirror shading. </p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Masses and Springs</h3>

<ol>
  <li>For this part, I used two new materials, glass and mirrors. For mirror materials, I used the reflect function and reflected the wo vector around (0,0,1) and set that two w1. I set the pdf to 1 since there is no sampling, and then returned the reflectance / cosine factor. </li>

  <li> When there are 0 bounces, there is only direct lighting, so we cannot see any of the reflection from the two glass balls in the middle. Conversely, at 100 bounces, we can see the two balls clearly. The lighting looks pretty natural as it does in the real world. As bounces increase, we can see more detail. </li>
